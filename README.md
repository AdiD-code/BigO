## Installation

Follow these instructions to set up TufanTicket on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Node.js 14+** and **npm**
- Git

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/AdiD-code/BigO.git](https://github.com/AdiD-code/BigO.git)
   cd BigO
   ```
   
2. **Rename Repository (optional):**

   ```bash
   mv BigO TufanTicket
   cd TufanTicket
   ```

3. **Create a Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install Python Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Configure Environment Variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory (if required) with necessary configurations such as `PORT`, `DATABASE_URL`, and `PAYMENT_GATEWAY_API_KEY`.

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install Node Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Frontend Server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend should now be available on your local development server, typically at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Data & Machine Learning Models

1. **Data Preparation:**

   Ensure that the datasets in the `data/kaggle` folder are correctly formatted. Update scripts in the `scripts` folder if needed.

2. **Model Training:**

   Navigate to the `ml_models` directory and run:

   ```bash
   python ../scripts/train_model.py
   ```

3. **Using Pre-Trained Models:**

   If you have pre-trained models, ensure they are placed in the `ml_models` folder and update the backend configuration accordingly.
